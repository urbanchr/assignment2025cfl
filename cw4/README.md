# CFL CW4


* [CW4 description](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/christian.urban/cfl/cws/cw04.pdf) (Marks 15%, deadline 14 Dec, 16:00)


For CW4 you will need an external assembler for the JVM. There are two options:

* [Jasmin](https://jasmin.sourceforge.net/)

* [Krakatau V1 (Python)](https://github.com/Storyyeller/Krakatau/tree/master)

* [Krakatau V2 (Rust)](https://github.com/Storyyeller/Krakatau/tree/v2)

If possible use Jasmin, as Krakatau has a tiny-bit different syntax than
Jasmin. 

If you use a different programming language than Ammonite/Scala3, you need to add all your code such that I can run it on my computer. Best would be a short HOWTO on what steps I need to do.
