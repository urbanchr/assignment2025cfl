# CFL CW3


* [CW3 description](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/christian.urban/cfl/cws/cw03.pdf) 

* add your code to `cw03.sc` (you need to make sure that the lexer from CW2
is loaded in your code)

* sample files are in the `examples` directory

* the main functions that will be tested are the parsers such as `Stmt.parse_all` and the interpreter `eval`

If you use a different programming language than Ammonite/Scala 3, you need to add all your code such that I am able to run it on my computer. Best would be a short HOWTO about what steps I need to do in order to test your code. In this case a proactive email to me might make things smoother and I can give my opinion.
