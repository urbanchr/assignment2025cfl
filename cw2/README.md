# CFL CW2

* [CW2 description](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/christian.urban/cfl/cws/cw02.pdf) 

* add your code to `cw02.sc`. The main function that will be tested is called 
`tokenise`.

* sample files are in the `examples` directory

If you use a different programming language than Ammonite/Scala 3, you need to add all your code such that I am able to run it on my computer. Best would be a short HOWTO about what steps I need to do in order to test your code. In this case a proactive email to me might make things smoother and I can give my opinion.
