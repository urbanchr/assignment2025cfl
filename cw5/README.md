# CFL CW5


* [CW5 description](https://cflmark.nms.kcl.ac.uk/hg/afl-material/raw-file/tip/cws/cw05.pdf) 


For CW5 you will need an external assembler for the LLVM-IR.


If you use a different programming language than Ammonite/Scala3, you need to add all your code such that I can run it on my computer. Best would be a short HOWTO on what steps I need to do.
